## Using React, Vite and TypeScript

This project implements a versatile Chip Component in React that allows users to input text, search for items, select them from a list, and convert them into chips. These chips can be removed individually by clicking the "X" icon. The component is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with an input field.
- Dynamic list filtering as the user types.
- Convert selected items into chips.
- Remove chips by clicking the "X" icon.
- Clean and maintainable React code.
- TypeScript for strong typing (bonus task).
- Highlight and delete the last chip when the input is blank and the user presses backspace (bonus task).
